# Friday-Project07
Hello, this is my friday project 7 containing all of the other previous weeks friday projects 1-6.

Friday Project One (I hope this is what you were asking in the instructions) 

Variables:

restaurant: Stores the name of a restaurant (e.g., "Burger King").
food1 and food2: Store two types of food (e.g., "pizza" and "ice cream").

Functionality:
The program uses input() to collect the user’s words.
The collected words are then placed into a story template.
Finally, the story with the user’s words inserted is printed out.

User Prompting:
The program prints out instructions for the user.
It then prompts the user to input each required word.

Template Filling:
After gathering the words, it inserts them into a story template using f-string formatting.
The story variable contains the completed Mad Lib.
Output:

Finally, the program prints the entire story with the user's words filled in, giving them a unique and humorous tale.
This code is fully functional, and users only need to run the program to get started on their Mad Lib adventure.

The program prints a message explaining its purpose to the user.
Random Number Generation:

main_numbers: The program generates a list of five numbers between 1 and 69 using randint.
powerball: It then generates one Powerball number between 1 and 26.
Formatting:

The main numbers are joined by a single space (" ".join(map(str, main_numbers))).
Three spaces are added between the main numbers and the Powerball number.

Finally, the program prints the complete ticket in the desired format.
