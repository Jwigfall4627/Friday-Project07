# Friday-Project07
Hello, this is my friday project 7 containing all of the other previous weeks friday projects 1-6. 

Friday Project One (I hope this is what you were asking in the instructions) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables:
large_object: Stores a single large object (e.g., "airplane").
large_objects: Stores plural large objects (e.g., "mountains").
adjective: Stores an adjective (e.g., "shiny").
body_part: Stores a body part (e.g., "elbow").
restaurant: Stores the name of a restaurant (e.g., "Burger King").
food1 and food2: Store two types of food (e.g., "pizza" and "ice cream").

Functionality:
The program uses input() to collect the user’s words.
The collected words are then placed into a story template.
Finally, the story with the user’s words inserted is printed out.

User Prompting:
The program prints out instructions for the user.
It then prompts the user to input each required word.

Template Filling:
After gathering the words, it inserts them into a story template using f-string formatting.
The story variable contains the completed Mad Lib.
Output:

Finally, the program prints the entire story with the user's words filled in, giving them a unique and humorous tale.
This code is fully functional, and users only need to run the program to get started on thier mad lib adventure.

Friday Project Two
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greeting:
The program prints a message explaining its purpose to the user.
Random Number Generation:

main_numbers: The program generates a list of five numbers between 1 and 69 using randint.
powerball: It then generates one Powerball number between 1 and 26.
Formatting:

The main numbers are joined by a single space (" ".join(map(str, main_numbers))).
Three spaces are added between the main numbers and the Powerball number.
Output:

Finally, the program prints the complete ticket in the desired format.

Friday Project 3 Needs to be generated by AI or uploaded using my own code...

Friday Project Four
trivia_questions: Stores the trivia questions as keys and their respective answers as values.

user_answer: Stores the user’s input for each question in the loop.

correct_answer: Temporarily holds the correct answer for each question during the loop to check against user_answer.
Loop and Conditional Statements:

The for loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.
Inside the loop, it prompts the user for their answer and checks it against the correct answer.
Feedback is provided based on whether the user’s answer is correct.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday Project Five
Functions:
Each function (red_text(), blue_text(), green_text(), yellow_text(), brown_text()) will take one parameter: text.
Each function will use ANSI escape codes to add color formatting to the input text and return the formatted string.
Variables:

text: The parameter for each function, which stores the user-inputted string to be displayed in color.
color_choice: Stores the color selected by the user in the main program logic.
user_text: Stores the text input provided by the user that will be colored based on their selection.
Main Program Logic:

Each color function is called and demonstrated by printing sample text in the respective color.
The program then prompts the user to choose a color and enter text to be displayed.
Using conditional statements, the program calls the appropriate function based on the user's color choice and prints the colored text.
