Hello, this is my friday project 7 containing all of the other previous weeks friday projects 1-6. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Friday Project One (I hope this is what you were asking in the instructions) 

Variables:
large_object: Stores a single large object (e.g., "airplane").
large_objects: Stores plural large objects (e.g., "mountains").

body_part: Stores a body part (e.g., "elbow").
restaurant: Stores the name of a restaurant (e.g., "Burger King").
food1 and food2: Store two types of food (e.g., "pizza" and "ice cream").

Functionality:
The program uses input() to collect the user’s words.
The collected words are then placed into a story template.
Finally, the story with the user’s words inserted is printed out.

User Prompting:
The program prints out instructions for the user.
It then prompts the user to input each required word.

Template Filling:
After gathering the words, it inserts them into a story template using f-string formatting.
The story variable contains the completed Mad Lib.
Output:

Finally, the program prints the entire story with the user's words filled in, giving them a unique and humorous tale.
This code is fully functional, and users only need to run the program to get started on their Mad Lib adventure.
